<p>
In the second task, I worked on a clustering problem using the "Mall Customer Segmentation Dataset" from Kaggle. 
The dataset included information about customers, such as customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

To begin, I encoded the gender feature because some machine learning models cannot handle categorical data directly. 
Additionally, I dropped the customer ID feature as it was not necessary for the clustering analysis.

Next, I applied the Elbow method to determine the optimal value of K for the K-means clustering model. 
The Elbow method helps in selecting the number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares as a function of the number of clusters. 
Based on the analysis, I found that the optimal value of K for your dataset was 5.

Finally, I used the matplotlib library to create visualizations in order to examine and interpret the results of the clustering analysis. 
These visualizations allowed me to gain insights into the customer segmentation and understand groups of customers that can be easily targeted for convergence. 
These insights can then be utilized by the marketing team to develop appropriate strategies.
